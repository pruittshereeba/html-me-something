            <h3><u>Cozumel</u></h3>
                <p>Cozumel turned out to be my favorite island! Although it was the hottest, it was the 
                    most enjoyable. My friends and I found great souvenirs there, swam with the fish, and
                    sampled some local goodies while our ship was docked there. The view was breath-taking
                    with well maintained beaches and lots to do! And... believe it or not, I got the most 
                    golden tan there, my skin was glowy golden for at least a week after!
