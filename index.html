            <h3><u>Cozumel</u></h3>

            <p>Cozumel turned out to be my favorite island! Although it was the hottest, it was the 
                most enjoyable. My friends and I found great souvenirs there, swam with the fish, and
                sampled some local goodies while our ship was docked there. The view was breath-taking
                with well maintained beaches and lots to do! And... believe it or not, I got the most 
                golden tan there, my skin was glowy golden for at least a week after!

            <p>Cayman was a lot of fun as well, we spent a day there and had a cookout. We chilled in the sun and
                and watched the waves and bought cool souvenirs. There was a flea market shop there that had hair
                braiders, a friend of mine had her hair braided and enjoyed learning about the braiders' family
                histories!

             <p>Nassau, Nassau, Nassau!!!! If you've never been I'd recommend it! We visited Atlantis, took a bus tour of the island, 
                 and sampled local food there. We went to a history museum that outlined Nassau's rich tourism history, and hung out 
                 with other cruisers in a nightclub. We found out that one thing that the locals do to make money is to be lookalikes, of 
                 celebrities like Ludacris! The lookalike didn't really look like Ludacris, but I gave him an A for effort! I had a great time
                 at Senor Frogs, nice bar, great music, and great drinks. I was right at the port, so we could make sure not to get left on the 
                 island!!!

            <p> In Biloxi, Mississippi I attended a Pruitt Family Reunion. My family is from a small town called Macon, Mississippi; so we 
                traveled to Biloxi for the reunion. We stayed at the Treasure Bay Casino Resort Hotel and did lots of activities, like a family 
                wellness day on the beach, gambled in the Casino, and had a black tie formal banquet. My family is an awesome group of people and 
                being able to spend 3 days with them in such a beautiful place was a lot of fun and helped us to unify even more! The staff was  
                hospitable and very good at managing such a large group of people for the event.
